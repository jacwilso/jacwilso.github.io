          <p class="lead">These are some in-progress tools from a game I an space game I am creating with a designer.</p>

          <h3>Wheel Segment Shader</h3>
          <p>The game revolves around actions points so rather than having the user enter into a UI screen
            a UI wheel is presented around the ship (cube in the images below). The wheel gets divided into
            segments based on how many actions that ship can do, which is vairable per ship so can't be a single
            texture. Originally I did this by using sprite masks but this had too many objects and masks. 
            I then programmed a shader which creates the donut shape (variably set by the developer), then depending on
            the number of segments needed will divide the circle into equal pieces. This can all be run during edit
            mode so the designer can see what he/she is changing.

          <h3>Firing Zone Debugger</h3>
          
          <p>The ship's (cubes) attacks on the face which is aimed toward another ship (cube), so this
            is a visualization tool for the designer (and myself) to be able to debug what face corresponds
            to the one pointing at another ship. The tool has 2 cubes with connecting lines (all displayed in white) 
            which display the field of view of each side of the ship. When debugging toward a certain ship
            the face pointing towards that ship will turn red. The math behind the calculation of the directions is
            simply 5 dot products (one for each face of the pseudo-frustum, excluding the far face since distance 
            isn't doesn't matter for this tool), if one fails (is negative) the object must be on another face of the
            ship. The reason for the weird rotations is the ships will be placed by the user in AR so weird angles
            are more likely, as well as the original tool didn't account for the angle of the ship.
