          <p class="lead">These were my take-aways from my first GDC:</p>
          	<ul class="lead">
          		<li>Attend the full day of summits for a field you're interested in a career in.</li>
          		<li>Go to every roundtable that is applicable to your desired profession.</li>
          		<li>The expo floor is as exciting as you make it.</li>
          	</ul>
          	<p class="lead">My experience isn't a blanket statement for all GDC attendees, however I believe if you are a student considering a career in the video game industry going to GDC is important.

          <p>The first day was possibly the most valuable for my career path, because it has helped guide what programming position I am most interested in. Prior to GDC, I knew I wanted to be a programmer in the games industry, however wasn't sure the position I was best suited for. I have done varying degrees of graphics, tools, and gameplay programming through different means (courses, personal projects, reading) and have begun exploring engine development. I enjoy an aspect of each field, which has made it difficult to have a decision on where I should focus my efforts. Additionally, what each position looks like in the industry isn't clear from the entry-level learning I am doing. I've been told being a jack-of-all trades isn't as valuable for AAA studios, as compared to being able to do one field well, particularly for entering into the industry.</p>

          <p>On Monday of GDC week, I chose to sit through the entire day of tools talks opposed to exploring other summits (particularly the advanced graphics talks which I also had interest in), since tools was more of an unknown from my student perspective. Most of the talks from the summit went right over my head, not having worked with most of the technology before, however the ones which presented information in a case studies or base principals were really interesting. That same evening I also attended a mixer put on by Geoff Evans, a tools programmer from Infinity Ward who organized the summit, where I had the opportunity to ask more direct questions to tools engineers about their jobs. From talking to industry professionals it is helping me plan an independent study to help advance my career in tools programming. All of the professionals I spoke to at the event had no qualms to speaking to me as a student, because I was expressing genuine interest in their craft (rather than asking for an internship).</p>

          <p>The tools summits talked ended on Monday, however there were also round-tables which is where developers meet to discuss problems they are having at their studio. This was a great opportunity to hear more about the specific problems studios are looking to solve, as well as a newcomer to the field be able to take note of keywords being repeated or emphasized. Even if you don't speak up at these events, people will start to recognize your face the more of the same topic you attend. I had LinkedIn messaged a speaker from one of the Monday talks, and I would like to believe that because she saw me at a round-table she responded.

          <p>GDC is also a great opportunity to meet other developers and see what technology companies are showing off. I found that the West conference hall is where I had most success in having interesting conversations with other professionals (because it was largely devoid of recruiters and other students). On my last day I took the time to walk the expo floor, and while it seemed most other students were enjoying their time I found myself finished after 15 minutes walking from end to end. I had no urge to walk into a booth and play what I could play at home or stand in a line to speak with a recruiter, it was interesting seeing the technology but the interest faded quick. The expo floor was also much closer to a consumer products conference rather than a conference about being a better developer.</p>

          <p>On the second day of the conference I thought I would spend most of my day in the math for programmers talks, since I had enjoyed the content from previous years (through GDC Youtube channel). However, I quickly found that the topics this year weren't as interesting for me, so I adapted my schedule for other talks. From people who I had spoken to prior to GDC it was recommended to me to sit in talks not directly related to my field, so that's what I did. I jumped from an indie talk to a gameplay/design talk on Edith Finch to some tech art talks. This was much more interesting because I got to meet professionals who weren't just programmers and I found these talks really intersesting. And by talking to people at these talks I made some really good connections and actually became interested in other fields that I was unsure of prior.</p>

          <p>Going to talks because of the speaker/game.The other piece of advice I got from other GDC experts was to go to talks about games you are interested in or people who you want to hear speak. For me, I went to a talk by Mike Acton who is the former principal engineer at Insomniac games and now principal engineer at Unity. I was excited about the talk because of the speaker which helped me to be excited about the talk. I heard great things from others about going to talks about Sonic because they were a huge fan of the game. I highly recommend skipping a technical talk for one that you get to listen to the creator of a game you enjoyed, because seeing that talk in person isn't something that can be replicated through the GDC vault.</p>
