          <p class="lead">After attending my first GDC there were a few large take-aways I had:</p>
          	<ul class="lead">
          		<li>If your a student, attend the whole day of summits of a field you're considering for a profession.</li>
          		<li>Go to every roundtable that can be applicable to you.</li>
          		<li>The expo floor isn't for everyone.</li>
          	</ul>
          	<p class="lead">I'm not sure if my experience is applicable to everyone, however I believe if you are considering getting a job in the video game industry go to GDC.
          </p>

          <!--If there are no summits directly related to your craft, jump around talks, especially summit talks to find out about mixer-->

          <p>The first day was possibly the most valuable for my career, because it has helped guide what programming position I am most interested in. Prior to GDC, I knew I wanted to be a programmer in the games industry, however wasn't sure what position that would materialize as. I have done varying degrees of graphics, tools, and gameplay programming through different means (courses, personal projects, reading) and have begun exploring engine programming because I am curious and want to know what I find most enjoyable. The problem is I enjoy each in some respect, and what each looks like in the industry isn't clear from entry-level learning. Additionally, being a jack-of-all trades doesn't seem as valuable compared to being able to do one well, particularly for entering into the industry.</p>

          <p>On Monday of GDC week, I chose to sit through the entire day of tools talks opposed to exploring other summits (particularly the advanced graphics talks), since tools was such an unknown from my student perspective. Most of the talks from the summit went right over my head not having worked with most of the technology before, however the ones which presented information in a case basis or base principals were really interesting. That same evening I also attended a mixer put on by Geoff Evans, the tools programmer from Infinity Ward who organized the summit, where I had the opportunity to ask more direct questions to tools engineers about their jobs. From talking to industry professionals it has helped me plan an independent study for future study of what I should be studying to continue to advance my career in tools programming.</p>

          <p>GDC large with great opportunity to meet other developers and see technology companies are showing off. I found that the West conference hall is where I had most success in having interesting conversations with other professionals (because it was largely devoid of recruiters and other students). On the last day I had the chance to walk the expo floor, and while it seemed most other expoers were enjoying their time I found myself finished after 15 minutes walking from end to end. I had no urge to walk into a booth and play what I could play at home or stand in a line to speak with a recruiter, it was interesting seeing the technology but the interest faded quick.</p>

          <p>On the second day of the conference I thought I would spend most of my day in the math for programmers talks, since I had enjoyed the content from previous years (through GDC Youtube channel). However, I quickly found that the topics weren't as interesting for me in person, so I adapted my schedule for other talks. From people who I had spoken to prior to GDC it was recommended to me to sit in talks not directly related to my field, so that's what I did. I jumped from an indie talk to a gameplay/design talk on Edith Finch to some tech art talks. This was much more interesting because I got to meet professionals who weren't just programmers and I found these talks really intersesting. And by talking to people at these talks I made some really good connections and actually became interested in other fields that I was unsure of prior.</p>
