          <p class="lead">This work was done for the Unity Neon Challenge, a contest challenging Unity developers to create a real-time environment using tools developed for the Unity Adam series. I developed tools to be used by the environment artist and established the workflow for the other artist's using Unity's tools.</p>

          <!-- Multi-scene: timeline, cinemachine, working with new features -->
          <h4>Multi-scene Timeline and Cinemachine</h4>
          <p>The development with Cinemachine and Timeline were closely intertwined, learning of one through using other. I initially tried to replicate the Adam pipeline as much as possible after reading the Adam Timeline blog, since it is considered to be the ideal use case. However, after just hours into replicating this workflow, I realized that Timeline and Cinemachine weren’t created with multi-scene editing capabilities.</p>

          <p>I committed to the multi-scene editing, since the team was working remotely and couldn’t afford to have someone perforce lock the scene, I needed to limit dependencies. After researching whether Timeline had any feature which could make it multi-scene capable, there were two forum posts in which Unity community members had suggestions to remedy this. By investigating their ideology and closely studying the Adam development blog, I accomplished multi-scene editing and by establishing a naming convention with the artists and validating the input, I allowed the artists to work independently and more efficiently.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Cinemachine was used to control the camera through the storyboard established by the artists. Early into development, I had to reevaluate the use of Cinemachine because there was over 40 separate cameras, frustums pictured above. I had to decide between allowing the artists to hand animate transistions between the camera positions or allowing Cinemachine to automate the process. The hand animation of the transitions would give the artists more control of the speed, direction, and look frustum; however the major drawback was time required to do this. There doesn’t seem like there is a convention yet with cinemachine on the approach to long cinematics, however because of the cinemachine brain I assumed that many camera’s was the approach the Cinemachine team had designed for and thus continued this approach.</p>

          <!-- Tooling -->
          <h4>Tooling</h4>
          <p>The scope of the project required modularization of assets and generation of environment. The artists had planned to build build detailed "modules" which would be part of the stack which consisted a building. Rather than having the artists individually place each module, I developed a simple tool which took many modules with defined heights then</p>
