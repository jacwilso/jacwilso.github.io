          <p class="lead">For this rapid prototype, I was co-programmer and focused on the polish of the experience in particular the shaders and state machine behaviour. The project was built in a 2-week period with a focus on story, the theme of the game is the feeling of love and compatibility with others.</p>

          <p>Since the focus of the round was on story, we spent significant time brainstorming as a team as well as individually to maximize idea generation. Initially I asked the other members of the team to outline the platforms, ideas, and themes they were interested in to make individual brainstorming more effective. After the first round of brainstorming as a team and individually, I tried to help merge ideas into something that everyone thought would make a good interactive story as well as being within scope. From there, I asked the team to reiterate the idea again and broke what I thought the sections of the game into programmer tasks. The flow of the game and task items are described in the second whiteboard image.</p>

          <p>The guest of the experience walks to the rhythm of the main character, literally and figuratively.The main character's heart is broken and is searching for love, and with the guests help it may find it. The feet connection is input with a Makey Makey through a close circuit connection between the feet and the aluminum taped cardboard floor. The prompt for a step is figured with a white foot, and the UI foot turns green when the guest is on the beat. Once the guest helps push the main character toward a character encounter the guest is prompted in the virtual and physical worlds to make a connection. The connection is formed when the 2 half-hearts are combined, the half-heart of the live actors contains all the wires so the guest can freely move their half. After connections are made, the main character tries to walk to the beat of the new relationship. When things between the characters are obviously not working out, the character breaks up with the main character and the guest continues on the journey. After a number of relationships, the guest will encounter a choice in who to love, one will lead to love where the other will lead to heart break.</p>

          <p>Playtesting for this project was considered invaluable because we were trying to convey such a natural emotion with subtle metaphors. If our metaphors were too subtle then the guest wouldn't get the feeling we wanted, but if they were overly prevelant then the guest could take the game as a joke and cliche. After we had a stable build after the first week, we tried to test with other classmates every other day at minimum. Through testing we learned that our metaphors were too subtle, especially in the case of breaking-up with another character. The game changed from the guest breaking-up with another character to the game character breaking-up with the guest/main character, because implanting an objective into a player's mind requires precise design choices which were out of scope for a 2-week project. The breakup was also emphasized with a lightning striking the hearts connected over the 2 character's hearts.</p>

          <p>The choice at the end of the game affects the game's outcome, with bad and good endings, we wanted the majority of players to choose the good ending thus had to make the choices dead obvious. We signaled the bad choice throughout the game with the purple hearts leading to heartbreak, as well as the bad choice being a robot, non-organic with sharp edges. The good choice however was more soft with a matching heart as the main character's as well as being the same heart the player saw at the introduction of the game.</p>

          <p>In the inital idea of the game, it was planned to have a sinusoid wave to represent the main character's heart and rhythm. With each encounter the wave would be overlayed with another wave which would represent the heart of the character you are entering a relation with. The other character's wave would have different forms of oscillations, such as damping and combinations of sine and cosine functions, so the shader needed to be able to display these functions. In addition the main character's wave was going to be modified after each relationship to signify a change of the character, so his journey was important of building it's personality. I created the shader with the modularity described, as well as creating a Unity scriptable object which contained the parameters to control the sinusoid shader. The idea was determined to be too visually distracting for the guest, so was scrapped which was another good learning experience of not becoming attached to code.</p>
