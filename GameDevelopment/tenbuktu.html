          <p class="lead">I programmed the game after learning the basics of Unity and published it on the Google Play Store after a week of development. I programmed the UI for different Android resolutions, animation state behaviour to scale with an increased speed, and persistent data (such as sound levels).</p>

          <p>TenBukTu is a collection of old western, arcade mini-games to test your reaction timing. The game scales with your speed, so as you progress and win more the rounds will speed up. There is a global leaderboard, where you can see the top 10 most wanted players. The game had players in US, Russia, India, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Since Unity Collab wasn't available publicly at the time, I was insistent that Github was used to share files and collaborate rather than any other format. By using a version control system we could each track the others work and not worry about files being lost in email. Although I had the project setup with Git, I hadn't done the research to initially make the meta files visible which ended up corrupting a portion of the project. This corruption set us back some work, however I had the knowledge of how the code worked and what the end result needed to be that I was able to rewrite the code in a fraction of the time with a cleaner version of the code. I also learned from this that I should save backups often and think of what external resources we will use prior to introducing it into the project. I am much more cautious of changes like this now and it has saved me from possible devestating project loss.
