				<p>
					The Isetta Engine project was a team of 4 junior developers developing our first game engine in just 3-months. 
					The goal wasn't to build the best engine but to help demystify engine development for ourselves as well as other novice engine developers by documenting the thoughts and decisions we made throughout. 
					Interviews were also conducted with industry professionals to pull gain insights and published in a book. 
				</p>
				<ul> <!-- TODO: condense -->					
					<li>Developed logging system with filtering to enable debugging</li>
					<li>Created a GUI abstraction layer using Dear, ImGui API</li>
					<li>Implemented an engine configuration system and built tool using WPF to manage</li>
					<li>Integrated 3rd-party profiler to enable performance profiling</li>
					<li>Setup the build system/pipeline for building engine into dll</li>
					<li>Handled resource management for engine and game, built asset processing tool</li>
					<li>Developed editor tools in engine (console, inspector, heirarchy)</li>
					<li>Integrated OpenGL over main rendering for debug drawing</li>
					<li>Hosted a game jam with the engine and wrote a post-mortem on the development</li>
					<li>Documented all technical desicions and implementation hosted on the website.</li>
					<li>Pitched the project to faculty through rounds of presentations and refinement</li>
